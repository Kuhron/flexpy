# flexpy

Python API for working with SIL FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx) databases. Some web scraping of Papuan Bible translations is also in here. Better organization and more features to come.

[Here](https://pypi.org/project/flexpy/) is the package's page on PyPI.

Install with:

    pip install flexpy

#### Example usage
    from flexpy.Corpus import Corpus
    
    project_dir = "/home/wesley/.local/share/fieldworks/Projects/"
    project_name = "Bongu"
    bongu_corpus = Corpus(project_dir, project_name)
    contents = bongu_corpus.get_tokenized_contents()  # already tokenized
    
    # now you can run statistics on contents
