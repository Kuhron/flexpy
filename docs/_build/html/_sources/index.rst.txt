Welcome to FlexPy's documentation!
==================================


FlexPy is a Python API for extracting data from SIL's FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx).
It can be used to make corpus analysis easier without having to export any data from FLEx itself.
This is useful because it allows you to edit your data in the FLEx GUI as you normally would, and then you can immediately re-run your FlexPy scripts to do your analysis without having to re-export anything.

To install:
::

    python -m pip install flexpy
