About setting up the imports correctly:
https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2421#issuecomment-332158308
- make the package installable
- install it in virtualenv while developing with pip install --editable /home/wesley/flexpy
-- NOT pip install --editable flexpy (this will put it somewhere else in the virtualenv site-packages or something, so your edits won't change anything in its behavior)
- test the package with tox
